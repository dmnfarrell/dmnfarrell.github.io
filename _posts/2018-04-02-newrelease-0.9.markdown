Some fixes in version 0.9.0 include an improved dialog for arranging plots in a grid layout. You can now zoom in and out of the table using buttons or the menu. It is now possible to find duplicates in your data. The column header menu has been cleaned up a bit to make it clearer.

A bug that caused large tables to loaded slowly has been fixed so you should not see a significant delay when opening most tables. A table with a million rows and say 5 columns should open in less than a second.

The [documentation](http://pandastable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been updated to give a better overview of functionality of the program. see the 'using dataexplore' section at
