## Background

As of October 2021, Ireland has an extremely high rate of adult vaccination of about 92%. However this does not appear to have altered the seasonal (and expected) rise in cases being seen as the Winter season begins. (Mass testing of the population continues at a high level in Ireland as it does in the UK). It is now apparent that despite providing protection from disease severity, vaccines do not significantly prevent transmission in vaccinated individuals. (This was probably not a realistic expectation to begin with and it was not even an endpoint of the trials). The continued trend in positive tests in most countries with high vaccination shows this quite clearly. There have also been several studies illustrating this, as detailed below.

## Wisconsin study

A US study <sup>[1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387v6)</sup> was conducted in July 2021 by Madison and Dane County health department of Wisconsin and published as a pre-print at medRxiv. They used PCR to estimate the concentration of virus in nasal-fluid samples and compared Ct values for 719 people (310 vaccinated and 389 unvaccinated) that had tested positive for SAR-CoV-2. 68% vaccinated and 63% of the unvaccinated group had Ct values less than 25, a level at which infectious SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible. It was because of this and some other studies that the CDC reversed its guidance on mask wearing for vaccinated people.

## UK study

More recently in the UK, a study published in the Lancet <sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099%2821%2900648-4)</sup> looked at the risk of COVID-19 transmission within households. This was done by following 205 household contacts of people with confirmed PCR positives, some of whom exhibited symptoms. 81% of these contacts had at least one vaccine dose, the remainder unvaccinated. 52/205 became positive including 31 of 126 who were doubly vaccinated (25%). For unvaccinated this rate was 38%, so slightly higher. The median length of time since vaccination was 101 days. So there may be a short period post vaccination where the susceptibility and/or infectivity are lower. The estimated peak viral load in infected individuals was the same regardless of vaccination status, although these levels dropped off more quickly in the vaccinated people. Most transmission probably happens around the peak of viral load. Note that RT-PCR is used as a proxy for infectiousness. The authors concluded that breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people can efficiently transmit infection in the household setting.

## Seasonality

We should remember that **seasonality** is the single overriding factor for the rise and fall of Covid related cases and deaths. Like flu, Covid is highly seasonal. This has to be controlled for when trying to assess the effect of measures meant to reduce transmission. This also means comparing any two countries in different locations is not really useful. This is shown below for 3 pairs of countries with close geographic locations and climates. Ireland and UK closely match in terms of curve shape. Is this because they both had lockdowns or simply because they are geographical neighbours? A better example might be Israel and Palestine which share a border. There is the same pattern but with a clear lag. The lag may partly be delays in reporting in Palestine but both countries showed the same pattern despite very different measures that include vaccine certs in Israel. Note that some large countries like the US will exhibit a mixture of seasonal periods from different regions. So the data will reflect a mixture of two seasonal signals.

Or take the following plot of three countries total Covid related deaths as they change over time. Each is plotted on it's own scale so as to compare the shape of the curves which are approximately the same. Sweden did not impose many of the strict measures applied in the UK and Ireland, so why are waves of infection spread almost identical (even though total numbers may differ, which is a different comparison problem). Sweden has now abandoned all Covid restrictions, along with Norway and Denmark.

## Vaccine certs

The European Union’s Covid-19 certificate (so-called vaccine passports) system was introduced in July 2021 for travel purposes. On July 26th Ireland began using vaccine certs for indoor dining, restaurants and pubs. Though due to be dropped on October 22nd, they have been extended into next year and their use has gradually expanded to other areas like theatres, cinemas and [even sporting activities](https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-40734912.html) for young people. The story is similar in other countries, each having their own arbitrary version of the policy, seemingly dependant only on the whims of each government. The policies are apparently designed to limit mixing of unvaccinated people with others in public spaces. But since transmission rates are similar in both groups it is hard to see the public health argument for such mandates unless as a form of coercion. There are no visible benefits and the harms to individuals on the wrong side of the rules are self evident.

It should be emphasised that the virus is now moving into the endemic phase. Any measures introduced to control or mediate the spread of such a virus can have a detrimental impact on society with little return. They must be carefully **evidence-based**, fair and proportional. The current vaccine passport approach surely violates those principles as laid down in the governments own [framework document](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/dbf3fb-ethical-framework-for-decision-making-in-a-pandemic/#).
