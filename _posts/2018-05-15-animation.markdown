An plot animator dialog has been introduced in DataExplore that allows you to move through the table in chunks and update the plot dynamically. The animation can also be recorded as a video. There are a few other options such as the ability to view the plot over an expanding window of the data, smoothing and fixing the x and y ranges. This would mostly be useful for time series based line plots but any kinds of plots can be animated. Formatting can be changed or column selections altered as the plot is updating, leading to some odd plot displays.

A possible development of this tool would be in updating streamed data in real-time. This feature is currently available in the snap beta channel version.
