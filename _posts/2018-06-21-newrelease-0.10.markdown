Version 0.10.0 adds a dot plot, plot animation dialog and column wrapping.

## Tables with long column headings

You can now handle long column names better by wrapping the text in the column header to get a better view of the names. The header will be resized to accomodate the longest name in the header up to a limit, as shown below. The function is accessed via the view menu. You can also right click in the column header and choose format->wrap header.

<div style="width: 600px;">
<a href="/img/column_wrapping.png"><img src="/img/column_wrapping.png" width="600px"></a>
</div>

In addition there are buttons at the bottom of the table that allow you to expand and contract the columns proportionally. This should be useful in conjunction with the zoom buttons to re-arrange the table to fit your data dynamically.
