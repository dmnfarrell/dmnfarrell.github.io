## Background

As of Winter 2021, European countries are experiencing increases in COVID-19 case numbers, despite continued attempts at mitigation and suppression. The measures taken do not appear to have altered the seasonal change in viral transmission.

**Seasonality** is in fact the single overriding factor for the rise and fall of Covid related cases and deaths. Like flu, Covid is appearing to be seasonal as it becomes endemic. [A study in GeoHealth](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GH000413) found that in countries with temperate climates Covid-19 peaked during the winter months, when temperature and humidity were low. In countries with tropical climates the cases peaked during the summer monsoons, when humidity was high.

This doesn't mean the virus disappears in warm weather but this has to be controlled for when trying to assess the effect of measures meant to reduce transmission. This also means comparing any two countries in different locations is not really useful. This is shown below for 3 pairs of countries with close geographic locations and climates. Ireland and UK closely match in terms of curve shape. Is this because they both had lockdowns or simply because they are geographical neighbours? A better example might be Israel and Palestine which share a border. There is the same pattern but with a clear lag. The lag may partly be delays in reporting in Palestine but both countries showed the same pattern despite very different measures that include vaccine certs in Israel. Note that some large countries like the US will exhibit a mixture of seasonal periods from different regions. So the data will reflect a mixture of two seasonal signals.

Or take the following plot of three countries total Covid related deaths as they change over time. Each is plotted on it's own scale so as to compare the shape of the curves which are approximately the same. Sweden did not impose many of the strict measures applied in the UK and Ireland, so why are waves of infection spread almost identical (even though total numbers may differ, which is a different comparison problem). Sweden has now abandoned all Covid restrictions, along with Norway and Denmark.

## Cases

Cases are a measure of positive PCR tests and are not a measure of impact of disease like hospital numbers and deaths. Though a proxy for viral prevalence they are loosely coupled to death rates, especially as population immunity rises. This is why the graph below of cases numbers for the same countries has different patterns. It is more 'noisy' as it's subject to other factors like quantity of testing, groups being tested, the parts of the population undergoing outbreaks and so on. Notice that the UK appears to precede Ireland in cases, though the pattern is not exact.
